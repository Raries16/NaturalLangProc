I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back.

They have not yet resolved the issue identified in that complaint or contacted me as they said they would in their response. I believe this new issue is just one more deceptive practice by this company that causes financial harm to borrowers.   \n",

Recently money was withdrawn on a couple of occasions without my permission or consent to pay for a timeshare account that was never used by me nor anyone connected to me because of unfair policies pertaining to the fees of the said timeshare. I tried cancelling the said timeshare account several times because of these fees that were never mentioned at the initiation. My account was debited to pay for the timeshare fees without my knowledge or consent several times. I tried correcting this with Wells Fargo bank with no avail. I would appreciate it if you can look into this matter for me. I was left with no funds in my account and as such I could not take care of the basic necessities of my day to day life. \\nThanks in advance,   \n",
