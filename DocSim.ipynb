       "'my dear countrymen     today  all indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the festival of independence  on this day of sacred festival of independence  the prime servant of india extends greetings to all dear countrymen     i am present amidst you not as the prime minister  but as the prime servant  the freedom struggle was fought for so many years  so many generations laid down their lives  innumerable people sacrificed their lives and youth  spent their entire lives behind bars  today  i pay my respect  greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country s independence     i also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious occasion of india s independence  and recall all those martyrs who had laid down their lives in india s struggle for freedom  the day of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of mother india  and also for the welfare of the poor  oppressed  dalits  the exploited   the backward people of our country     my dear countrymen  a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character  this national festival inspires us to resolve ourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further  to dedicate ourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the nation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration to take india to newer heights     mas 3514   684    my dear countrymen  this nation has neither been built by political leaders nor by rulers nor by governments  this nation has been built by our farmers  our workers  our mothers and sisters  our youth  the country has reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by our sages  our saints  our maestros  our teachers  our scientists and social workers  these great people and these great generations  who had worked for the country throughout their lives  deserve our deepest respect  this is the beauty of india s constitution  this is its capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town  a poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri colour of india at the ramparts of   lal quila  red fort   this is the strength of india s democracy  this is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution  i pay my respects to those architects of the constitution of india today     brothers and sisters  today if we have reached here after independence  it is because of the contribution of all the prime ministers  all the governments and even the governments of all the states  i want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and ex prime ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day india to such heights and who have added to the country s glory     this country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage  where we were told of only one  mantra during   vedic period  which is indicative of our work culture  which we have learnt  we have memorized      sangachchhdhvam samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam   we walk together  we move together  we think together  we resolve together and together we take this country forward  having imbibed this basic mantra  125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward  yesterday only the first parliamentary session of the new government had concluded  today  i can proudly say that the session of parliament reflects our thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions  we are not for moving forward on the basis of majority  we are not interested to move forward by virtue of majority  we want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus     sangachhadhwam  and  therefore  the nation has witnessed the entire session of parliament  having taken all the parties and opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder  we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the prime minister alone  the credit does not go to the people sitting in the government  the credit for this goes to the opposition also  the credit goes to all the leaders of opposition too and also all the members from opposition  from the ramparts of red fort  quite proudly i salute all the members of parliament  i also salute all the political parties and by virtue of their strong support  we could take some important decisions intended to take the nation forward and yesterday the session of parliament had concluded     brothers and sisters  i am an outsider for delhi  i am not a native of delhi  i have no idea about the administration and working of this place  i have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two months while being an outsider  i had an insider view and i was astonished  it is not a political platform  rather it is a platform of a national policy and  therefore  my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective  i have already said  i salute all the ex prime ministers and earlier governments who have brought the country thus far  but i am going to say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view  when i came to delhi and noticed an insider view  i felt what it was and i was surprised to see it  it seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running at the same time in one main government  it appeared that everyone has its own fiefdom  i could observe disunity and conflict among them  one department is taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching supreme court this disunity  this conflict among people of the same country  how come we can take the country forward  and that is why i have started making efforts for razing those walls  i have started making efforts at making the government   not an assembled entity  but an organic unity  an organic entity  a harmonious whole  with one aim  one mind  one direction  one energy  let s resolve to steer the country to one destination  we have it in us to move in that direction  a few days back   nowadays newspapers are full of news that modiji s government has come  officers are reaching office on time  offices open in time  and people get there in time  i observed that india s national newspapers  tv media were carrying these news items prominently  as the head of the government i could have derived pleasure in the fact that everything started going on time  cleanliness got the attention  but i was not taking pleasure  i was feeling pained  that thing  i want to tell today in public  and why  because if government officers arrive office in time  does that make a news  and if that makes news  it shows how low we have fallen  it becomes a proof of that  and that s how  brothers and sisters  the governments have run  today  in the face of global competition   when we have to realize the dreams of millions of indians   the country cannot run on the lines of   it happens     it goes   in order to fulfil the aspirations of masses  we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery  we have to make it keen  more dynamic  and it is in this direction that we are working  my countrymen  it s not long since i have come from outside delhi  but i give you an assurance that the people in the government are very capable   from the peon to the cabinet secretary  everybody is capable  everybody has a power  they have experience  i want to awaken that power  i want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the welfare of nation through that power and i shall definitely do it  i want to assure the countrymen that we will achieve that  we will definitely do that  i could not say this on 16th may  but today after my experience of two two and half months  keeping the tricolor as witness  i am saying on 15th of august that it is possible  it will be achieved     brothers and sisters  time has come to give a serious thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create india of the dreams of those great people who gave us freedom  whether we have a national character     brothers and sisters  can someone please tell me as to whether he or she has ever introspected in the evening after a full day s work as to whether his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not  whether his or her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not  whether the actions have been directed in country s welfare or not  whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step in life should be in the country s interests  unfortunately  we have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work  he begins by saying  what does it mean for me   he begins by saying  what does it involve for me   and when he come to know that it does not entail any benefit for him  immediately he says  why should i bother   we have to rise above the feelings of  what does it mean for me  and  why should i bother   everything is not for self interest only  there are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this national character  we have to rise above the feelings of  why should i bother  and  what does it mean for me  and instead we have to think that  i am for nation s interest and in this field  i am going to lead   we have to inculcate this sentiment     brothers and sisters  when we hear about the incidents of rape  we hang our heads in shame  people come out with different arguments  someone indulges in psycho analysis  but brothers and sisters  today from this platform  i want to ask those parents  i want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age  you are always on the alert  every now and then you keep on asking where are you going  when would you come back  inform immediately after you reach  parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions  but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going  why he is going out  who his friends are  after all  a rapist is also somebody s son  he also has parents  as parents  have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going  if every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed on our daughters  try to do this with your sons  try to ask such questions of them     my dear brothers and sisters  the law will take its own course  strict action will be taken  but as a member of the society  as parents  we also have some responsibilities  if somebody tells me that those who have taken guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists  are terrorists  but they are also somebody s children  i would like to ask of such parents if they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path  every parent must take this responsibility  he must know that his misguided son is bent on killing innocent people  he is not able to serve himself nor his family nor the country  i want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are  it is all because of mother india only that they have got it  whoever you are it is all because of your parents  i want to ask you to think how green  how beautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the plough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land  how long shall we have bloodshed on this land  how long shall we take the lives of the innocent people and what have we got after all this  the path of violence has not yielded anything to us     brothers and sisters  i had gone to nepal recently  there i said something publicly to draw the attention of the whole world  there was a time when the emperor ashoka who had chosen the path of wars  got converted to the path of buddha at the sight of violence  there was a time in nepal when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today i witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution  the same people associated with them are framing the constitution  and i further said that if nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon the path of violence     brothers and sisters  if nepal  land of budha  can give message to the world then why can t india too do the same  so it s the call of the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood     brothers and sisters  for one reason or the other  we have had communal tensions for ages  this led to the division of the country  even after independence  we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism  how long these evils will continue  whom does it benefit  we have had enough of fights  many have been killed  friends  look behind and you will find that nobody has benefited from it  except casting a slur on mother india  we have done nothing  therefore  i appeal to all those people that whether it is the poison of casteism  communalism  regionalism  discrimination on social and economic basis  all these are obstacles in our way forward  let s resolve for once in our hearts  let s put a moratorium on all such activities for ten years  we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions  and you will see that how much strength we get from peace  unity  goodwill and brotherhood  let s experiment it for once     my dear countrymen  believe in my words  i do assure you  shun all the sins committed so far  give up that way  follow the way of goodwill and brotherhood  and let s resolve to take the country forward  i believe we can do that     with advancement of science  brothers and sisters  we have a  rising feeling of modernity in our mind  but what do we do  have we ever thought what the sex ratio in the country is like  940 girls are born against per thousand boys  who is causing this imbalance in the society  certainly not god  i request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their own pockets   i advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the hope of son  sometimes mother father feel tempted to have son in the hope of supporting them in old age  i am a person who has worked in public life  i have come across families with five sons  each having bungalows  access to fleet of cars  but parents are forced to live in old age homes  vriddhashrams   i have seen such families  i have also seen families with only daughter as progeny  that daughter sacrifices her dreams  doesn t get married  and spends entire life in taking care of old parents   this disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has  we will have to liberate from it  and that is message to us of this freedom festival     l2014081555813   684    recently commonwealth games were organized  indian sportspersons brought glory to the country  nearly 64 of our sportspersons won  our sportspersons brought 64 medals  but of them 29 are girls  let s feel proud and clap for them  girls also contribute to india s fame and glory  let s recognise it  let s take them along  shoulder to shoulder  this way we can get over the evils that have crept in social life  therefore  brothers and sisters  we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national character  brothers and sisters  development is the only way forward for the country  good governance is the only way  there are only these two tracks to take the country forward   good governance and development  we can move forward only by taking them with us  we wish to move forward with the intent of taking them with us  when i talk of good governance  you tell me  when i ask a person in private job  he tells that he does the job  when you ask the same from a person in government job  he says that i do the service  both earn  but for one it is job while for the other it is service  i ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service  whether the word  service  has not lost its strength  its identity  persons in government service are not doing  job   they are doing  service   we have to revive this feeling  we have to take this feeling forward as a national character  we have to move forward in this direction     brothers and sisters  whether the citizens of the country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not  you imagine  if this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward  then the country moves 125 crore steps forward  the meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a government  but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together joining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country  this is the meaning of democracy  we have to create partnership with the people  we have to proceed under public private partnership  we have to proceed along with the participation of the people  but  please tell me why our farmers commit suicide  a farmer takes loan from the moneylender  but fails to repay his loans  he takes loan for the wedding of his daughter  but fails to repay  he will have to suffer hardships during his whole life  he chooses to commit suicide  who will save the poor families of such farmers     brothers and sisters  i have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme on this festival of freedom  it will be called   pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana   i wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the facility of bank accounts through this   yojana  there are millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts  we have to change this scenario  economic resources of the country should be utilized for the well being of the poor  the change will commence from this point  this   yojana will open the window  therefore  an account holder under    pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana  will be given a debit card  an insurance of one lakh rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor family  so that such families are covered with the insurance of one lakh rupees in case of any crisis in their lives     my brothers and sisters  it is a country of young people  the 65 percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years  our country has the largest number of youths in the world  have we ever thought of deriving an advantage out of it  today  the world needs a skilled workforce  today  india also needs a skilled workforce  at times  we look for a good driver but he is not available  we look for a plumber  but he is not available  if we need a good cook  he is not available  we have young people  they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available  if we have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be  skill development  and  skilled india   millions and millions of indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems  they should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making india a modern country  whenever they go to any country in the world  their skills must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development  i also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the opportunities  they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any corner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the world through their skills  we want to go for the capacity building of such young people  my brothers and sisters  having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace  i want to accomplish this     brothers and sisters  the world has undergone a change  my dear countrymen  the world has changed  now india can not decide its future by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner  the economics of the world have changed and  therefore  we will have to act accordingly  government have taken many decisions recently  made some announcements in the budget and i call upon the world and call upon the indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more employment to the youth  we will have to promote manufacturing sector  if we have to develop a balance between imports and exports  we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector  if we have to put in use the education  the capability of the youth  we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for this hindustan also will have to lend its full strength  but we also invite world powers  therefore i want to appeal all the people world over  from the ramparts of the red fort   come  make in india    come  manufacture in india   sell in any country of the world but manufacture here  we have got skill  talent  discipline  and determination to do something  we want to give the world an favourable opportunity that come here   come  make in india  and we will say to the world  from electrical to electronics   come  make in india   from automobiles to agro value addition  come  make in india   paper or plastic   come  make in india   satellite or submarine  come  make in india   our country is powerful  come  i am giving you an invitation     brothers and sisters  i want to call upon the youth of the country  particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector  i want to call upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country  as i say to the world  come  make in india   i say to the youth of the country   it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world   made in india   this should be our dream  whether  to serve the country  is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like bhagat singh  brothers and sisters  lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan  jai jawan  jai kisan   a soldier sacrifices himself at the border and protects mother india  similarly  a farmer serves mother india by filling the godowns with grains  this is also nation s service  filling the granary is the biggest nation s service that a farmer provides  that is why lal bahadur shashtri had given the slogan of  jai jawan  jai kisan      man 9012 684    brothers and sisters  i would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to why despite them  we are forced to import even the smallest of things  my country s youth can resolve it  they should conduct research  try to find out as to what type of items are imported by india and then each one should resolve that  through may be micro or small industries only  he would manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in future  we should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export such items  if each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture atleast one such item  india can become a net exporter of goods  i  therefore  urge upon the youth  in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise  atleast on two counts  first  zero defect and  second again zero effect  we should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect  that our exported goods are never returned to us  we should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment  if we march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector then  my brothers and sisters  i am confident that we would be able to achieve our goals     brothers and sisters  the youth of india has completely transformed the identity of india in the world  earlier  in what manner did the world know our country   till only 25 30 years back  if not more  there were many people in the world who thought that india was a country of snake charmers  it was a country which practiced in black magic  the real identity of india had not reached the world  but my dear brothers and sisters  our youngsters  20 22 23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their skills in computers  our young i t  professionals have given a new path of making a new identity of india  if our country has this strength  can we think something about the country  our dream is  therefore  of  digital india   when i talk of  digital india   i don t speak of the elite  it is for the poor people  you can imagine what a quality education the children in villages will get  if all the villages of india are connected with broadband connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools in every remote corner of the villages  if we create a network of telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors  we can have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor people living in those areas  the citizens of india have mobile phones in their hands  they have mobile connectivity  but can we walk in the direction of mobile governance  we have to move in a direction where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his mobile  is able to demand various things from the government  can submit applications  can conduct all his business  while on the move  through mobile governance and if this has to be done  we have to move towards  digital india  and if we have to move towards  digital india  then we have a dream  today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale  friends  you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions  mobile phones  i pads and all these electronic goods  it is a necessity to import petroleum products  oil  diesel and petrol  second to this is the import of our electronic goods  if we move ahead with the dream of  digital india  to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there  how big can be the benefit for the treasury  therefore  e governance is what we need to take this idea of  digital india  forward  e governance is easy governance  effective governance and also economic governance  e governance paves the way for good governance  there was a time when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country  that was it  i say that today it is it that has the potential to connect each and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of unity with the help of  digital india      brothers and sisters  if we move ahead with all this then i believe that a  digital india  will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing  our youth have that capability  it is an opportunity for them     brothers and sisters  we want to promote tourism  tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor  gram seller earns something  auto rickshaw driver earns something  pakoda seller earns something and tea seller also earns something  when there is talk of tea seller  i feel a sense of belongingness  tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor  but there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and that is   the filthiness all around us  whether after independence  after so many years of independence  when we stand at the threshold of one and half decade of 21st century  we still want to live in filthiness  the first work i started here after formation of government is of cleanliness  people wondered whether it is a work of a prime minister  people may feel that it is a trivial work for a prime minister but for me this a big work  cleanliness is very big work  whether our country can not be clean  if one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness  which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages  can t we resolve this much     brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi in 2019  how do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi  mahatma gandhi  who gave us freedom  who brought so much honour to such a big country in the world  what do we give to mahatma gandhi  brothers and sisters  mahatma gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart  whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village  city  street  area  school  temple  hospital  and what have you   by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi  this happens not just with the government  but with public participation  that s why we have to do it together     brother and sisters  we are living in 21st century  has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open  whether dignity of women is not our collective responsibility  the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night  until darkness descends  they can t go out to defecate  what bodily torture they must be feeling  how many diseases that act might engender  can t we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters  brothers and sisters  somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th august is an occasion to talk big  brothers and sisters  talking big has its importance  making announcements too has importance  but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled  the society sinks into a state of despondency  that s why are in favour of telling those things  which we can fulfil just within our sight  brothers and sisters  you must be getting shocked to hear the prime minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the red fort  brothers and sisters  i do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it  but this is my heartfelt conviction  i come from a poor family  i have seen poverty  the poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness  i  therefore  have to launch a  clean india  campaign from 2nd october this year and carry it forward in 4 years  i want to make a beginning today itself and that is   all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls  only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway  our parliamentarians utilizing mplad fund are there  i appeal to them to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year  the government should utilise its budget on providing toilets  i call upon the corporate sector also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your expenditure under corporate social responsibility  this target should be finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next 15th august  we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no school in india without separate toilets for boys and girls     brothers and sisters  if we proceed with the dreams  we are in a position to realise them  today  i wish to tell one more specific thing  it has its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation s interest  however  our members of parliament do not get opportunity though they are willing to do something  they can express themselves  write to the government  agitate  give memoranda  still they do not get opportunity to do something on their own  today i have come to you with a new idea  we are running so many schemes in the name of the prime minister in our country  there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders  however  today i am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the member of parliament     sansad aadarsh gram yojana   we shall fix some parameters  i urge upon the members of parliament to select any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your constituency  the parameters will be according to the time  space and situation of that locality  it will include the conditions of health  cleanliness  atmosphere  greenery  cordiality etc  on the basis of those parameters  each of our mps should make one village of his or her constituency a model village by 2016  can t we do at least this  shouldn t we do this  if we have to build a nation  we should start from the village  make a model village  the reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme  it takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it  after 2016  select two more villages for this purpose  before we go for the general elections in 2019  and after 2019  each member of parliament  during his her tenure of 5 years must establish at least five model villages in his her area  i also call upon the members of parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of their choice  i also urge upon the members of parliament from rajya sabha to adopt one of the villages  if we provide one model village in each district of india then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow that model  let us establish a model village  let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and facilities  the birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji happens to be on 11th october  on 11th october  the occasion of birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji  i will present a complete blueprint of    s   nsad adharsh gr   m yojana   members of parliament model village scheme  before all members of parliament and state governments  and i urge upon state governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states  all the members of legislative assembly resolve to establish a model village  you can imagine all the members of legislative assembly and all the members of parliament in the country establishing a model village  all of a sudden  there would be a model village in each block of india which could inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new direction and  therefore  we want to move ahead under this   s   nsad adarsh gr   m yojana      my dear brothers and sisters  ever since our government has taken charge  there has been a discussion in the newspapers  on t v  channels as to what would happen to planning commission  i believe that when planning commission was constituted  it was done on the basis of the circumstances and the needs of those times  in recent years  planning commission has contributed to the growth of the country in its own way  i respect that  i am proud of that  but the prevalent situation in the country is different  global scenario has also changed  governments are no longer the centre of economic activities  the scope of such activities has broadened  state governments have been at the center of development and i consider this a good indication  if we have to take india forward  it can happen only be taking the states forward   india s federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years  to strengthen our federal structure  to make our federal structure vibrant  to take our federal structure as a heritage of development  a team of chief minister and prime minister should be there  a joint team of the centre and the states should move forward  then to do this job  we will have to think about giving the planning commission a look  so  i am saying from the rampart of the red fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated  it will have to be changed a lot  sometimes it costs more to repair the old house  but  it gives us no satisfaction  thereafter  we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period  we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new design and structure  a new body  a new soul  a new thinking  a new direction  a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on creative thinking  public private partnership  optimum utilization of resources  utilization of youth power of the nation  to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development  to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure  very shortly  we are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in place of planning commission     brothers and sisters  today  on 15th august  we also have the birth anniversary of maharishi aurobindo  maharishi aurobindo  being a rebel  moved on to achieve the status of a yoga guru  with regard to the destiny of india  he remarked   i have a faith that the divine power and spiritual heritage of india will play an important role towards the welfare of the world   such sentiments were echoed by maharishi arvind  i strongly believe in the words of legends  i have great faith in the statements made by ascetics  sages   saints and that s why today at the ramparts of lal quila i am reminded of the words of swami viveknanda  he had said    i can see before my eyes mother india awakening once again  my mother india would be seated as the world guru  every indian would render service towards welfare of humanity  this legacy of india would be useful for the welfare of the world   these words were spoken by swami viveknanda ji in his own style  friends  the words of viveknanda ji can never be untrue  the words of viveknanda ji  his dream of seeing india ensconced as world guru  his vision  it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream  this capable country  blessed with natural bounty  this country of youth can do much for the world in the coming days     brothers and sisters  our foreign policy is a much talked about issue  i clearly believe that india s foreign policy can be multi dimensional  but there is an important issue to which i want to draw your attention that the way we fought for freedom  we fought together  we were not separate at that time  we were together  which was the government with us  what were the weapons available to us  there was a gandhi  a sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire  didn t we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire  did we not defeat the foreign powers  did we not force them to leave india  we were the ones  they were our ancestors only who showed this might  if the people of india could remove such a big empire without the power of the government  without weapons and even without resources  then friends  it is the need of the hour to eradicate poverty  can we not overcome poverty  can we not defeat poverty  my 125 crore dear countrymen  let us resolve to eradicate poverty  to win against it  let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from india  our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem  why not get together with all the saarc nations to plan out the fight against poverty  let s fight together and defeat poverty  let us see at least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed  this is the land where incidents from siddharth s life happened  one bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it  they went to mother  whose bird  whose swan  whether killer s or saviour s  they asked of mother  the mother replied  saviour s  the saviour has more power than the killer and that makes him buddha in future  and that s why i seek cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate with them  so that together with saarc countries we can create our importance and emerge as a power in the world  it is imperative that we work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty  shoulder to shoulder  i went to bhutan  nepal  all the dignitaries from saarc countries took part in oath taking ceremony  this marked a good beginning  this will definitely yield good results  it is my belief and this thinking of india  in the country and the world  that we want to do well to the countrymen and be useful for the welfare of the world  india wants such a hand to be extended  we are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them     brothers and sisters  today on 15th august we will resolve to do something for the country  let s be useful for the country  we will move ahead with a resolve to take the country forward  and i assure you  brothers and sisters  as well as my colleagues in the government  that if you work for 12 hours  i will do so for 13 hours  if you work for 14 hours  i will do for 15 hours  why  because i m amidst you not as a prime minister  but as the first servant  i have formed the government not as a ruler  but as a servant  brothers and sisters  i assure that this country has a destiny  it is destined to work for the welfare of the world  it was said by vivekanand ji  india is born  this hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny  one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare of the nation     once again i feel proud of the devotion  the sacrifices of the security forces of the country  para military forces of the country  all the security forces of the country to protect mother india  i say to the countrymen                                 eternal vigilance is the price of liberty   the army is vigilant  we should also be vigilant and the country scales new heights  we have to move forward with this resolution  speak loudly with me with full force      bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai     jai hind  jai hind  jai hind     vande mataram  vande mataram  vande mataram '"

       "'my dear countrymen     today  all indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the festival of independence  on this day of sacred festival of independence  the prime servant of india extends greetings to all dear countrymen     i am present amidst you no so many generations laid down their lives  innumerable people sacrificed their lives and youth  spent their entire lives behind bars  today  i pay my respect  greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country s independence     i also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious occasion of india s independence  and recall all those martyrs who had laid down their lives in india s struggle for freedom  the day of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of mother india  and also for the welfare of the poor  oppressed  dalits  the exploited   the backward people of our country     my dear countrymen  a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character  this national festiva to newer heights     mas 3514   684    my dear countrymen  this nation has neither been built by political leaders nor by rulers nor by governments  this nation has been built by our farmers  our workers  our mothers and sisters  our youth  the country has reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by our sages  our saints  our maestros  our teachers  our scientists and social workers  these great people and these great generations  who had worked for the country throughout their lives  deserve our deepest respect  this is the beauty of india s constitution  this is its capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town  a poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri colour of india at the ramparts of   lal quila  red fort   this is the strength of india s democracy  this is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution  i pay my respects to those architects of the constitution of india today     brothers and sisters  today if we have reached here after independence  it is because of the contribution of all the prime ministers  all the governments and even the governments of all the states  i want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and ex prime ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day india to such heights and who have added to the country s glory     this country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage  where we were told of only one  mantra during   vedic period  which is indicative of our work culture  which we have learnt  we have memorized      sangachchhdhvam samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam   we walk together  we move together  we think togetions  we are not for moving forward on the basis of majority  we are not interested to move forward by virtue of majority  we want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus     sangachhadhwam  and  therefore  the nation has witnessed the entire session of parliament  having taken all the parties and opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder  we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the prime minister alone  the credit does not go to the people sitting in the government  the credit for this goes toopers from opposition  from the ramparts of red fort  quite proudly i salute all the members of parliament  i also salute all the political parties and by virtue of their strong support  we could take some important decisions intended to take the nation forward and yesterday the session of parliament had concluded     brothers and sisters  i am an outsider for delhi  i am not a native of delhi  i have no idea about the administration and working of this place  i have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two months while being an outsider  i had an insider view and i was astonished  it is not a political platform  rather it is a platform of a national policy and  therefore  my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective  i have already said  i salute all the ex prime ministers and earlier governments who have brought the country thus far  but i am going to say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view  when i came to delhi and noticed an insider view  i felt what it was and i was surprised to see it  it seemed as if dozens of separate governmedom  i could observe disunity and conflict among them  one department is taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching supreme court this disunity  this conflict among people of the same country  how come we can take the country forward  and that is why i have started making efforts for razing those walls  i have started making efforts at making the government   not an assembled entity  but an organic unity  an organic entity  a harmonious whole  with one aim  one mind  one direction  one energy  let s resolve to steer the country to one destination  we have it in us to move in that direction  a few days back   nowadays newspapers are full of news that modiji s government has come  officers are reaching office on time  offices open in time  and people get there in time  i observed that india s national newspapers  tv media were carrying these news items prominently  ive office in time  does that make a news  and if that makes news  it shows how low we have fallen  it becomes a proof of that  and that s how  brothers and sisters  the governments have run  today  in the face of global competition   when we have to realize the dreams of millions of indians   the country cannot run on the lines of   it happens     it goes   in order to fulfil the aspirations of masses  we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery  we have to make it keen  more dynamic  and it is in this direction that we are working  my countrymen  it s not long since i have come from outside delhi  but i give you an assurance that the people in the government are very capable   from the peon to the cabinet secretary  everybody is capable  everybody has a power  they have experience  i want to awaken that power  i want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the welfare of nation through that power and i shall definitely do it  i want to assure the countrymen that we will achieve that  we will definitely do that  i could not say this on 16th may  but today after my experience of two two and half months  keeping the tricolor as witness  i am saying on 15th of august that it is possible  it will be achieved     brothers and sisters  time has come to give a serious thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create india of the dreams of those great people who gave us freedom  whether we have a national character     brothers and sisters  can someone please tell me as to whether he or she has ever introspected in the evening after a full day s work as to whether his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not  whether his or her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not  whether the actions have been directed in country s welfare or not  whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step in life should be in the country s interests  unfortunately  we have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work  he begins by saying  what does it mean for me   he begins by saying  what does it involve for me   and when he come to know that it does not entail any benefit for him  immediately he says  why should i bother   we have to rise above the feelings of  what does it mean for me  and  why should i bother   everything is not for self interest only  there are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this national character  we have to rise above the feelings of  why should i bother  and  what does it mean for me  and instead we have to think that  i am for nation s interest and in this field  i am going to lead   we have to inculcate this sentiment     brothers and sisters  when we hear about the incidents of rape  we hang our heads in shame  people come out with different arguments  someone indulges in psycho analysis  but brothers and sisters  today from this platform  i want to ask those parents  i want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age  you are always on the alert  every now and then you keep on asking where are you going  when would you come back  inform immediately after you reach  parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions  but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going  why he is going out  who his friends are  after all  a rapist is also somebody s son  he also has parents  as parents  have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going  if every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed on our daughters  try to do this with your sons  try to ask such questions of them     my dear brothers and sisters  the law will take its own course  strict action will be taken  but as a member of the society  as parents  we also have some responsibilities  if somebody tells me that those who have taken guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists  are terrorists  but they are also somebody s children  i would like to ask of such parents if they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path  every parent must take this responsibility  he must know that his misguided son is bent on killing innocent people  he is not able to serve himself nor his family nor the country  i want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are  it is all because of mother india only that they have got it  whoever you are it is all because of your parents  i want to ask you to think how green  how beautiful and how beneficial this  their constitution  the same people associated with them are framing the constitution  and i further said that if nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon the path of violence     brothers and sisters  if nepal  land of budha  can give message to the world then why can t india too do the same  so it s the call of the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood     brothers and sisters  for one reason or the other  we have had communal tensions for ages  this led to the division of the country  even after independence  we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism  how long these evils will continue  whom does it benefit  we have had enough of fights  many have been killed  friends  look behind and you will find that nobody has benefited from it  except casting a slur on mother india  we have done nothing  therefore  i appeal to all those people that whether it is the poison of casteism  communalism  regionalism  discrimination on social and economic basis  all these are obstacles in our way forward  let s resolve for once in our hearts  let s put a moratorium on all such activities for ten years  we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions  and you will see that how much strength we get from peace  unity  goodwill and brotherhood  let s experiment it for once     my dear countrymen  believe in my words  i do assure you  shun all the sins committed so far  give up that way  follow the way of goodwill and brotherhood  and let s resolve to take the country forward  i believe we can do that     with advancement of science  brothers and sisters  we have a  rising feeling of modernity in our mind  but what do we do  have we ever thought what the sex ratio in the country is like  940 girls are born against per thousand boys  who is causing this imbalance in the society  certainly not god  i request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their own pockets   i advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the hope of son  sometimes mother father feel tempted to have son in the hope of supporting them in old age  i am a person who has worked in public life  i have come across families with five sons  each having bungalows  access to fleet of cars  but parents are forced to live in old age homes  vriddhashrams   i have seen such families  i have also seen families with only daughter as progeny  that daughter sacrifices her dreams  doesn t get married  and spends entire life in taking care of old parents   this disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has  we will have to liberate from it  and that is message to us of this freedom festival     l2014081555813   684    recently commonwealth games were organized  indian sportspersons brought glory to the country  nearly 64 of our sportspersons won  our sportspersons brought 64 medals  but of them 29 are girls  let s feel proud and clap for them  girls also contribute to india s fame and glory  let s recognise it  let s take them along  shoulder to shoulder  this way we can get over the evils that have crept in social life  therefore  brothers and sisters  we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national character  brothers and sisters  development is the only way forward for the country  good governance is the only way  there are only these two tracks to take the country forward   good governance and development  we can move forward only by taking them with us  we wish to move forward with the intent of taking them with us  when i talk of good governance  you tell me  when i ask a person in private job  he tells that he does the job  when you ask the same from a person in government job  he says that i do the service  both earn  but for one it is job while for the other it is service  i ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service  whether the word  service  has not lost its strength  its identity  persons in government service are not doing  job   they are doing  service   we have to revive this feeling  we have to take this feeling forward as a national character  we have to move forward in this direction     brothers and sisters  whether the citizens of the country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not  you imagine  if this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward  then the country moves 125 crore steps forwahe government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country  this is the meaning of democracy  we have to create partnership with the people  we have to proceed under public private partnership  we have to proceed along with the participation of the people  but  please tell me why our farmers commit suicide  a farmer takes loan from the moneylender  but fails to repay his loans  he takes loan for the wedding of his daughter  but fails to repay  he will have to suffer hardships during his whole life  he chooses to commit suicide  who will save the poor families of such farmers     brothers and sisters  i have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme on this festival of freedom  it will be called   pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana   i wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the facility of bank accounts through this   yojana  there are millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts  we have to change this scenario  economic resources of the country should be utilized for the well being of the poor  the change will commence from this point  this   yojana will open the window  therefore  an account holder under    pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana  will be given a debit card  an insurance of one lakh rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor family  so that such families are covered with the insurance of one lakh rupees in case of any crisis in their lives     my brothers and sisters  it is a country of young people  the 65 percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years  our country has the largest number of youths in the world  have we ever thought of deriving an advantage out of it  today  the world needs a skilled workforce  today  india also needs a skilled workforce  at times  we look for a good driver but he is not available  we look for a plumber  but he is not available  if we need a good cook  he is not available  we have young people  they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available  if we have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be  skill development  and  skilled india   millions and millions of indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems  they should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making india a modern country  whenever they go to any country in the world  their skills must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pracity building of such young people  my brothers and sisters  having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace  i want to accomplish this     brothers and sisters  the world has undergone a change  my dear countrymen  the world has changed  now india can not decide its future by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner  the economics of the world have changed and  therefore  we will have to act accordingly  government have taken many decisions recently  made some announcements in the budget and i call upon the world and call upon the indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more employment to the youth  we will have to promote manufacturing sector  if we have to develop a balance between imports and exports  we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector  if we have to put in use the education  the capability of the youth  we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for this hindustan also will have to lend its full strength  but we also invite world powers  therefore i want to appeal all the people world over  from the ramparts of the red fort   come  make in india    come  manufacture in india   sell in any country of the world but manufacture here  we have got skill  talent  discipline  and determination to do something  we want to give the world an favourable opportunity that come here   come  make in india  and we will say to the world  from electrical to electronics   come  make in india   from automobiles to agro value addition  come  make in india   paper or plastic   come  make in india   satellite or submarine  come  make in india   our country is powerful  come  i am giving you an invitation     brothers and sisters  i want to call upon the youth of the country  particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector  i want to call upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country  as i say to the world  come  make in india   i say to the youth of the country   it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world   made in india   this should be our dream  whether  to serve the country  is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like bhagat singh  brothers and sisters  lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan  jai jawan  jai kisan   a soldier sacrifices himself at the border and protects mother india  similarly  a farmer serves mother india by filling the godowns with grains  this is also nation s service  filling the granary is the biggest nation s service that a farmer provides  that is why lal bahadur shashtri had given the slogan of  jai jawan  jai kisan      man 9012 684    brothers and sisters  i would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to why despite them  we are forced to import even the smallest of things  my country s youth can resolve it  they should conduct research  try to find out as to what type of items are imported by india and then each one should resolve that  through may be micro or small industries only  he would manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in future  we should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export such items  if each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture atleast one such item  india can become a net exporter of goods  i  therefore  urge upon the youth  in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise  atleast on two counts  first  zero defect and  second again zero effect  we should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect  that oud  but my dear brothers and sisters  our youngsters  20 22 23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their skills in computers  our young i t  professionals have given a new path of making a new identity of india  if our country has this strength  can we think something about the country  our dream is  therefore  of  digital india   when i talk of  digital india   i don t speak of the elite  it is for the poor people  you can imagine what a quality education the children in villages will get  if all the villages of india are connected with broadband connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools in every remote corner of the villages  if we create a network of telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors  we can have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor people living in those areas  the citizens of india have mobile phones in their hands  they have mobile connectivity  but can we walk in the direction of mobile governance  we have to move in a direction where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his mobile  is able to demand various things from the government  can submit applications  can conduct all his business  while on the move  through mobile governance and if this has to be done  we have to move towards  digital india  and if we have to move towards  digital india  then we have a dream  today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale  friends  you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions  mobile phones  i pads and all these electronic goods  it is a necessity to import petroleum products  oil  diesel and petrol  second to this is the import of our electronic goods  if we move ahead with the dream of  digital india  to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there  how big can be the benefit for the treasury  therefore  e governance is what we need to take this idea of  digital india  forward  e governance is easy governance  effective governance and also economic governance  e governance paves the way for good governance  there was a time when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country  that was it  i say that today it is it that has the potential to connect each and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of unity with the help of  digital india      brothers and sisters  if we move ahead with all this then i believe that a  digital india  will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing  our youth have that capability  it is an opportunity for them     brothers and sisters  we want to promote tourism  tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor  gram seller earns something  auto rickshaw driver earns something  pakoda seller earns something and tea seller also earns something  when there is talk of tea seller  i feel a sense of belongingness  tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor  but there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and that is   the filthiness all arot the threshold of one and half decade of 21st century  we still want to live in filthiness  the first work i started here after formation of government is of cleanliness  people wondered whether it is a work of a prime minister  people may feel that it is a trivial work for a prime minister but for me this a big work  cleanliness is very big work  whether our country can not be clean  if one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness  which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages  can t we resolve this much     brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi in 2019  how do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi  mahatma gandhi  who gave us freedom  who brought so much honour to such a big country in the world  what do we give to mahatma gandhi  brothers and sisters  mahatma gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart  whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village  city  street  area  school  temple  hospital  and what have you   by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi  this happens not just with the government  but with public participation  that s why we have to do it together     brother and sisters  we are living in 21st century  has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open  whether dignity of women is not our collective responsibility  the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night  until darkness descends  they can t go out to defecate  what bodily torture they must be feeling  how many diseases that act might engender  can t we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters  brothers and sisters  somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th august is an occasion to talk big  brothers and sisters  talking big has its importance  making announcements too has importance  but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled  the society sinks into a state of despondency  that s why are in favour of telling those things  which we can fulfil just within our sight  brothers and sisters  you must be getting shocked to hear the prime minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the red fort  brothers and sisters  i do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it  but this is my heartfelt conviction  i come from a poor family  i have seen poverty  the poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness  i  therefore  have to launch a  clean india  campaign from 2nd october this year and carry it forward in 4 years  i want to make a beginning today itself and that is   all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls  only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway  our parliamentarians utilizing mplad fund are there  i appeal to them to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year  the government should utilise its budget on providing toilets  i call upon the corporate sector also to give priority to the provision of tobrothers and sisters  if we proceed with the dreams  we are in a position to realise them  today  i wish to tell one more specific thing  it has its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation s interest  however  our members of parliament do not get opportunity though they are willing to do something  they can express themselves  write to the government  agitate  give memoranda  still they do not get opportunity to do something on their own  today i have come to you with a new idea  we are running so many schemes in the name of the prime minister in our country  there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders  however  today i am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the member of parliament     sansad aadarsh gram yojana   we shall fix some parameters  i urge upon the members of parliament to select any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your constituency  the parameters will be according to the time  space and situation of that locality  it will include the conditions of health  cleanliness  atmosphere  greenery  cordiality etc  on the basis of those parameters  each of our mps should make one village of his or her constituency a model village by 2016  can t we do at least this  shouldn t we do this  if we have to build a nation  we should start from the village  make a model village  the reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme  it takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it  after 2016  select two more villages for this purpose  before we go for the general elections in 2019  and after 2019  each member of parliament  during his her tenure of 5 years must establish at least five model villages in his her area  i also call upon the members of parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of their choice  i also urge upon the members of parliament from rajya sabha to adopt one of the villages  if we provide one model village in each district of india then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow that model  let us establish a model village  let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and facilities  the birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji happens to be on 11th october  on 11th october  the occasion of birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji  i will present a complete blueprint of    s   nsad adharsh gr   m yojana   members of parliament model village scheme  before all members of parliament and state governments  and i urge upon state governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states  all the members of legislative assembly resolve to establish a model village  you can imagine all the members of legislative assembly and all the members of parliament in the country establishing a model village  all of a sudden  there would be a model village in each block of india which could inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new direction and  therefore  we want to move ahead under this   s   nsad adarsh gr   m yojana    the country in its own way  i respect that  i am proud of that  but the prevalent situation in the country is different  global scenario has also changed  governments are no longer the centre of economic activities  the scope of such activities has broadened  state governments have been at the center of development and i consider this a good indication  if we have to take india forward  it can happen only be taking the states forward   india s federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years  to strengthen our federal structure  to make our federal structure vibrant  to take our federal structure as a heritage of development  a team of chief minister and prime minister should be there  a joint team of the centre and the states should move forward  then to do this job  we will have to think about giving the planning commission a look  so  i am saying from the rampart of the red fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated  it will have to be changed a lot  sometimes it costs more to repair the old house  but  it gives us no satisfaction  thereafter  we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period  we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new design and structure  a new body  a new soul  a new thinking  a new direction  a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on creative thinking  public private partnership  optimum utilization of resources  utilization of youth power of the nation  to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development  to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure  very shortly  we are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in place of planning commission     brothers and sisters  today  on 15th august  we also have the birth anniversary of maharishi aurobindo  maharishi aurobindo  being a rebel  moved on to achieve the status of a yoga guru  with regard to the destiny of india  he remarked   i have a faith that the divine power and spiritual heritage of india will play an important role towards the welfare of the world   such sentiments were echoed by maharishi arvind  i strongly believe in the words of legends  i have great faith in the statements made by ascetics  sages   saints and that s why today at the ramparts of lal quila i am reminded of the words of swami viveknanda  he had said    i can see before my eyes mother india awakening once again  my mother india would be seated as the world guru  every indian would render service towards welfare of humanity  this legacy of india would be useful for the welfare of the world   these words were spoken by swami viveknanda ji in his own style  friends  the words of viveknanda ji can never be untrue  the words of viveknanda ji  his dream of seeing india ensconced as world guru  his vision  it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream  this capable country  blessed with natural bounty  this country of youth can do much for the world in the coming days     brothers and sisters  our foreign policy is a much talked about issue  i clearly believe that india s foreign policy can be multi dimensional  but there is an important issue to which i want to draw your attention that the way we fought for freedom  we fought together  we were not separate at that time  we were together  which was the government with us  what were the weapons available to us  there was a gandhi  a sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire  didn t we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire  did we not defeat the foreign powers  did we not force them to leave india  we were the ones  they were our ancestors only who showed this might  if the people of india could remove such a big empire without the power of the government  without weapons and even without resources  then friends  it is the need of the hour to eradicate poverty  can we not overcome poverty  can we not defeat poverty  my 125 crore dear countrymen  let us resolve to eradicate poverty  to win against it  let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from india  our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem  why not get together with all the saarc nations to plan out the fight against poverty  let s fight together and defeat poverty  let us see at least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed  this is the land where incidents from siddharth s life happened  one bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it  they went to mother  whose bird  whose swan  whether killer s or saviour s  they asked of mother  the mother replied  saviour s  the saviour has more power than the killer and that makes him buddha in future  and that s why i seek cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate with them  so that together with saarc countries we can create our importance and emerge as a power in the world  it is imperative that we work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty  shoulder to shoulder  i went to bhutan  nepal  all the dignitaries from saarc countries took part in oath taking ceremony  this marked a good beginning  this will definitely yield good results  it is my belief and this thinking of india  in the country and the world  that we want to do well to the countrymen and be useful for the welfare of the world  india wants such a hand to be extended  we are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them     brothers and sisters  today on 15th august we will resolve to do something for the country  let s be useful for the country  we will move ahead with a resolve to take the country forward  and i assure you  brothers and sisters  as well as my colleagues in the government  that if you work for 12 hours  i will do so for 13 hours  if you work for 14 hours  i will do for 15 hours  why  because i m amidst you not as a prime minister  but as the first servant  i have formed the government not as a ruler  but as a servant  brothers and sisters  i assure that this country has a destiny  it is destined to work for the welfare of the world  it was said by vivekanand ji  india is born  this hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny  one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare of the nation     once again i feel proud of the devotion  the sacrifices of the security forces of the country  para military forces of the country  all the security forces of the country to protect mother india  i say to the countrymen                                 eternal vigilance is the price of liberty   the army is vigilant  we should also be vigilant and the country scales new heights  we have to move forward with this resolution  speak loudly with me with full force      bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai     jai hind  jai hind  jai hind     vande mataram  vande mataram  vande mataram '"

       "'my dear countrymen     today  all indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the festival of independence  on this day of sacred festival of independence  the prime servant of india extends greetings to all dear countrymen     i am present amidst you not as the prime minister  but as the prime servant  the freedom struggle was fought for so many years  so many generations laid down their lives  innumerable people sacrificed their lives and youth  spent their entire lives behind bars  today  i pay my respect  greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country s independence     i also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious occasion of india s independence  and recall all those martyrs who had laid down their lives in india s struggle for freedom  the day of independence is a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of mother india  and also for the welfare of the poor  oppressed  dalits  the exploited   the backward people of our country     my dear countrymen  a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character  this national festival inspires us to resolve ourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further  to dedicate ourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the nation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration to take india to newer heights     mas 3514   684    my dear countrymen  this nation has neither been built by political leaders nor by rulers nor by governments  this nation has been built by our farmers  our workers  our mothers and sisters  our youth  the country has reached here today because of generation to generation rigours undertaken by our sages  our saints  our maestros  our teachers  our scientists and social workers  these great people and these great generations  who had worked for the country throughout their lives  deserve our deepest respect  this is the beauty of india s constitution  this is its capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town  a poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri colour of india at the ramparts of   lal quila  red fort   this is the strength of india s democracy  this is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our architects of the constitution  i pay my respects to those architects of the constitution of india today     brothers and sisters  today if we have reached here after independence  it is because of the contribution of all the prime ministers  all the governments and even the governments of all the states  i want to express my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and ex prime ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day india to such heights and who have added to the country s glory     this country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage  where we were told of only one  mantra during   vedic period  which is indicative of our work culture  which we have learnt  we have memorized      sangachchhdhvam samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam   we walk together  we move together  we think together  we resolve together and together we take this country forward  having imbibed this basic mantra  125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward  yesterday only the first parliamentary session of the new government had concluded  today  i can proudly say that the session of parliament reflects our thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions  we are not for moving forward on the basis of majority  we are not interested to move forward by virtue of majority  we want to move ahead on the basis of strong consensus     sangachhadhwam  and  therefore  the nation has witnessed the entire session of parliament  having taken all the parties and opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder  we achieved an unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the prime minister alone  the credit does not go to the people sitting in the government  the credit for this goes to the opposition also  the credit goes to all the leaders of opposition too and also all the members from opposition  from the ramparts of red fort  quite proudly i salute all the members of parliament  i also salute all the political parties and by virtue of their strong support  we could take some important decisions intended to take the nation forward and yesterday the session of parliament had concluded     brothers and sisters  i am an outsider for delhi  i am not a native of delhi  i have no idea about the administration and working of this place  i have been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two months while being an outsider  i had an insider view and i was astonished  it is not a political platform  rather it is a platform of a national policy and  therefore  my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective  i have already said  i salute all the ex prime ministers and earlier governments who have brought the country thus far  but i am going to say something else and it may not be seen from political point of view  when i came to delhi and noticed an insider view  i felt what it was and i was surprised to see it  it seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running at the same time in one main government  it appeared that everyone has its own fiefdom  i could observe disunity and conflict among them  one department is taking on the other department and taking on to the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting against each other by approaching supreme court this disunity  this conflict among people of the same country  how come we can take the country forward  and that is why i have started making efforts for razing those walls  i have started making efforts at making the government   not an assembled entity  but an organic unity  an organic entity  a harmonious whole  with one aim  one mind  one direction  one energy  let s resolve to steer the country to one destination  we have it in us to move in that direction  a few days back   nowadays newspapers are full of news that modiji s government has come  officers are reaching office on time  offices open in time  and people get there in time  i observed that india s national newspapers  tv media were carrying these news items prominently  as the head of the government i could have derived pleasure in the fact that everything started going on time  cleanliness got the attention  but i was not taking pleasure  i was feeling pained  that thing  i want to tell today in public  and why  because if government officers arrive office in time  does that make a news  and if that makes news  it shows how low we have fallen  it becomes a proof of that  and that s how  brothers and sisters  the governments have run  today  in the face of global competition   when we have to realize the dreams of millions of indians   the country cannot run on the lines of   it happens     it goes   in order to fulfil the aspirations of masses  we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery  we have to make it keen  more dynamic  and it is in this direction that we are working  my countrymen  it s not long since i have come from outside delhi  but i give you an assurance that the people in the government are very capable   from the peon to the cabinet secretary  everybody is capable  everybody has a power  they have experience  i want to awaken that power  i want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the welfare of nation through that power and i shall definitely do it  i want to assure the countrymen that we will achieve that  we will definitely do that  i could not say this on 16th may  but today after my experience of two two and half months  keeping the tricolor as witness  i am saying on 15th of august that it is possible  it will be achieved     brothers and sisters  time has come to give a serious thought to the fact that whether we have a duty to create india of the dreams of those great people who gave us freedom  whether we have a national character     brothers and sisters  can someone please tell me as to whether he or she has ever introspected in the evening after a full day s work as to whether his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not  whether his or her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not  whether the actions have been directed in country s welfare or not  whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen that every step in life should be in the country s interests  unfortunately  we have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some work  he begins by saying  what does it mean for me   he begins by saying  what does it involve for me   and when he come to know that it does not entail any benefit for him  immediately he says  why should i bother   we have to rise above the feelings of  what does it mean for me  and  why should i bother   everything is not for self interest only  there are certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this national character  we have to rise above the feelings of  why should i bother  and  what does it mean for me  and instead we have to think that  i am for nation s interest and in this field  i am going to lead   we have to inculcate this sentiment     brothers and sisters  when we hear about the incidents of rape  we hang our heads in shame  people come out with different arguments  someone indulges in psycho analysis  but brothers and sisters  today from this platform  i want to ask those parents  i want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age  you are always on the alert  every now and then you keep on asking where are you going  when would you come back  inform immediately after you reach  parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions  but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going  why he is going out  who his friends are  after all  a rapist is also somebody s son  he also has parents  as parents  have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going  if every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have been imposed on our daughters  try to do this with your sons  try to ask such questions of them     my dear brothers and sisters  the law will take its own course  strict action will be taken  but as a member of the society  as parents  we also have some responsibilities  if somebody tells me that those who have taken guns on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists  are terrorists  but they are also somebody s children  i would like to ask of such parents if they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path  every parent must take this responsibility  he must know that his misguided son is bent on killing innocent people  he is not able to serve himself nor his family nor the country  i want to say to those youngsters who have chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are  it is all because of mother india only that they have got it  whoever you are it is all because of your parents  i want to ask you to think how green  how beautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the plough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land  how long shall we have bloodshed on this land  how long shall we take the lives of the innocent people and what have we got after all this  the path of violence has not yielded anything to us     brothers and sisters  i had gone to nepal recently  there i said something publicly to draw the attention of the whole world  there was a time when the emperor ashoka who had chosen the path of wars  got converted to the path of buddha at the sight of violence  there was a time in nepal when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today i witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution  the same people associated with them are framing the constitution  and i further said that if nepal could present the best example of moving from the weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in the world to abandon the path of violence     brothers and sisters  if nepal  land of budha  can give message to the world then why can t india too do the same  so it s the call of the hour that we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood     brothers and sisters  for one reason or the other  we have had communal tensions for ages  this led to the division of the country  even after independence  we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism  how long these evils will continue  whom does it benefit  we have had enough of fights  many have been killed  friends  look behind and you will find that nobody has benefited from it  except casting a slur on mother india  we have done nothing  therefore  i appeal to all those people that whether it is the poison of casteism  communalism  regionalism  discrimination on social and economic basis  all these are obstacles in our way forward  let s resolve for once in our hearts  let s put a moratorium on all such activities for ten years  we shall march ahead to a society which will be free from all such tensions  and you will see that how much strength we get from peace  unity  goodwill and brotherhood  let s experiment it for once     my dear countrymen  believe in my words  i do assure you  shun all the sins committed so far  give up that way  follow the way of goodwill and brotherhood  and let s resolve to take the country forward  i believe we can do that     with advancement of science  brothers and sisters  we have a  rising feeling of modernity in our mind  but what do we do  have we ever thought what the sex ratio in the country is like  940 girls are born against per thousand boys  who is causing this imbalance in the society  certainly not god  i request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just to line their own pockets   i advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice daughters in the hope of son  sometimes mother father feel tempted to have son in the hope of supporting them in old age  i am a person who has worked in public life  i have come across families with five sons  each having bungalows  access to fleet of cars  but parents are forced to live in old age homes  vriddhashrams   i have seen such families  i have also seen families with only daughter as progeny  that daughter sacrifices her dreams  doesn t get married  and spends entire life in taking care of old parents   this disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and tainted mind the 21st century has  we will have to liberate from it  and that is message to us of this freedom festival     l2014081555813   684    recently commonwealth games were organized  indian sportspersons brought glory to the country  nearly 64 of our sportspersons won  our sportspersons brought 64 medals  but of them 29 are girls  let s feel proud and clap for them  girls also contribute to india s fame and glory  let s recognise it  let s take them along  shoulder to shoulder  this way we can get over the evils that have crept in social life  therefore  brothers and sisters  we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national character  brothers and sisters  development is the only way forward for the country  good governance is the only way  there are only these two tracks to take the country forward   good governance and development  we can move forward only by taking them with us  we wish to move forward with the intent of taking them with us  when i talk of good governance  you tell me  when i ask a person in private job  he tells that he does the job  when you ask the same from a person in government job  he says that i do the service  both earn  but for one it is job while for the other it is service  i ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service  whether the word  service  has not lost its strength  its identity  persons in government service are not doing  job   they are doing  service   we have to revive this feeling  we have to take this feeling forward as a national character  we have to move forward in this direction     brothers and sisters  whether the citizens of the country should take steps for the welfare of the nation or not  you imagine  if this 125 crores of countrymen move one step forward  then the country moves 125 crore steps forward  the meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a government  but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together joining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the country  this is the meaning of democracy  we have to create partnership with the people  we have to proceed under public private partnership  we have to proceed along with the participation of the people  but  please tell me why our farmers commit suicide  a farmer takes loan from the moneylender  but fails to repay his loans  he takes loan for the wedding of his daughter  but fails to repay  he will have to suffer hardships during his whole life  he chooses to commit suicide  who will save the poor families of such farmers     brothers and sisters  i have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme on this festival of freedom  it will be called   pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana   i wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the facility of bank accounts through this   yojana  there are millions of families who have mobile phones but no bank accounts  we have to change this scenario  economic resources of the country should be utilized for the well being of the poor  the change will commence from this point  this   yojana will open the window  therefore  an account holder under    pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana  will be given a debit card  an insurance of one lakh rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor family  so that such families are covered with the insurance of one lakh rupees in case of any crisis in their lives     my brothers and sisters  it is a country of young people  the 65 percent population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years  our country has the largest number of youths in the world  have we ever thought of deriving an advantage out of it  today  the world needs a skilled workforce  today  india also needs a skilled workforce  at times  we look for a good driver but he is not available  we look for a plumber  but he is not available  if we need a good cook  he is not available  we have young people  they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are not available  if we have to promote the development of our country then our mission has to be  skill development  and  skilled india   millions and millions of indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems  they should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making india a modern country  whenever they go to any country in the world  their skills must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development  i also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the opportunities  they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any corner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the world through their skills  we want to go for the capacity building of such young people  my brothers and sisters  having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace  i want to accomplish this     brothers and sisters  the world has undergone a change  my dear countrymen  the world has changed  now india can not decide its future by remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner  the economics of the world have changed and  therefore  we will have to act accordingly  government have taken many decisions recently  made some announcements in the budget and i call upon the world and call upon the indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more employment to the youth  we will have to promote manufacturing sector  if we have to develop a balance between imports and exports  we will have to strengthen manufacturing sector  if we have to put in use the education  the capability of the youth  we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for this hindustan also will have to lend its full strength  but we also invite world powers  therefore i want to appeal all the people world over  from the ramparts of the red fort   come  make in india    come  manufacture in india   sell in any country of the world but manufacture here  we have got skill  talent  discipline  and determination to do something  we want to give the world an favourable opportunity that come here   come  make in india  and we will say to the world  from electrical to electronics   come  make in india   from automobiles to agro value addition  come  make in india   paper or plastic   come  make in india   satellite or submarine  come  make in india   our country is powerful  come  i am giving you an invitation     brothers and sisters  i want to call upon the youth of the country  particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector  i want to call upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country  as i say to the world  come  make in india   i say to the youth of the country   it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the world   made in india   this should be our dream  whether  to serve the country  is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like bhagat singh  brothers and sisters  lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan  jai jawan  jai kisan   a soldier sacrifices himself at the border and protects mother india  similarly  a farmer serves mother india by filling the godowns with grains  this is also nation s service  filling the granary is the biggest nation s service that a farmer provides  that is why lal bahadur shashtri had given the slogan of  jai jawan  jai kisan      man 9012 684    brothers and sisters  i would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to why despite them  we are forced to import even the smallest of things  my country s youth can resolve it  they should conduct research  try to find out as to what type of items are imported by india and then each one should resolve that  through may be micro or small industries only  he would manufacture atleast one such item so that we need not import the same in future  we should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to export such items  if each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to manufacture atleast one such item  india can become a net exporter of goods  i  therefore  urge upon the youth  in particular our small entrepreneurs that they would never compromise  atleast on two counts  first  zero defect and  second again zero effect  we should manufacture goods in such a way that they carry zero defect  that our exported goods are never returned to us  we should manufacture goods with zero effect that they should not have a negative impact on the environment  if we march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector then  my brothers and sisters  i am confident that we would be able to achieve our goals     brothers and sisters  the youth of india has completely transformed the identity of india in the world  earlier  in what manner did the world know our country   till only 25 30 years back  if not more  there were many people in the world who thought that india was a country of snake charmers  it was a country which practiced in black magic  the real identity of india had not reached the world  but my dear brothers and sisters  our youngsters  20 22 23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their skills in computers  our young i t  professionals have given a new path of making a new identity of india  if our country has this strength  can we think something about the country  our dream is  therefore  of  digital india   when i talk of  digital india   i don t speak of the elite  it is for the poor people  you can imagine what a quality education the children in villages will get  if all the villages of india are connected with broadband connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the schools in every remote corner of the villages  if we create a network of telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors  we can have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be provided to the poor people living in those areas  the citizens of india have mobile phones in their hands  they have mobile connectivity  but can we walk in the direction of mobile governance  we have to move in a direction where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his mobile  is able to demand various things from the government  can submit applications  can conduct all his business  while on the move  through mobile governance and if this has to be done  we have to move towards  digital india  and if we have to move towards  digital india  then we have a dream  today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale  friends  you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions  mobile phones  i pads and all these electronic goods  it is a necessity to import petroleum products  oil  diesel and petrol  second to this is the import of our electronic goods  if we move ahead with the dream of  digital india  to manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there  how big can be the benefit for the treasury  therefore  e governance is what we need to take this idea of  digital india  forward  e governance is easy governance  effective governance and also economic governance  e governance paves the way for good governance  there was a time when we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country  that was it  i say that today it is it that has the potential to connect each and every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of unity with the help of  digital india      brothers and sisters  if we move ahead with all this then i believe that a  digital india  will have the potential to stand with the world on equal footing  our youth have that capability  it is an opportunity for them     brothers and sisters  we want to promote tourism  tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor  gram seller earns something  auto rickshaw driver earns something  pakoda seller earns something and tea seller also earns something  when there is talk of tea seller  i feel a sense of belongingness  tourism provide employment to the poorest of the poor  but there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national character and that is   the filthiness all around us  whether after independence  after so many years of independence  when we stand at the threshold of one and half decade of 21st century  we still want to live in filthiness  the first work i started here after formation of government is of cleanliness  people wondered whether it is a work of a prime minister  people may feel that it is a trivial work for a prime minister but for me this a big work  cleanliness is very big work  whether our country can not be clean  if one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness  which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages  can t we resolve this much     brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi in 2019  how do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi  mahatma gandhi  who gave us freedom  who brought so much honour to such a big country in the world  what do we give to mahatma gandhi  brothers and sisters  mahatma gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart  whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village  city  street  area  school  temple  hospital  and what have you   by 2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi  this happens not just with the government  but with public participation  that s why we have to do it together     brother and sisters  we are living in 21st century  has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open  whether dignity of women is not our collective responsibility  the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night  until darkness descends  they can t go out to defecate  what bodily torture they must be feeling  how many diseases that act might engender  can t we just make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters  brothers and sisters  somebody might feel that a big festival like 15th august is an occasion to talk big  brothers and sisters  talking big has its importance  making announcements too has importance  but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the hopes are not fulfilled  the society sinks into a state of despondency  that s why are in favour of telling those things  which we can fulfil just within our sight  brothers and sisters  you must be getting shocked to hear the prime minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the ramparts of the red fort  brothers and sisters  i do not know how my speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it  but this is my heartfelt conviction  i come from a poor family  i have seen poverty  the poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness  i  therefore  have to launch a  clean india  campaign from 2nd october this year and carry it forward in 4 years  i want to make a beginning today itself and that is   all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls  only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway  our parliamentarians utilizing mplad fund are there  i appeal to them to spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year  the government should utilise its budget on providing toilets  i call upon the corporate sector also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your expenditure under corporate social responsibility  this target should be finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next 15th august  we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no school in india without separate toilets for boys and girls     brothers and sisters  if we proceed with the dreams  we are in a position to realise them  today  i wish to tell one more specific thing  it has its own importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation s interest  however  our members of parliament do not get opportunity though they are willing to do something  they can express themselves  write to the government  agitate  give memoranda  still they do not get opportunity to do something on their own  today i have come to you with a new idea  we are running so many schemes in the name of the prime minister in our country  there are numerous schemes in the name of various leaders  however  today i am going to announce a scheme on behalf of the member of parliament     sansad aadarsh gram yojana   we shall fix some parameters  i urge upon the members of parliament to select any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your constituency  the parameters will be according to the time  space and situation of that locality  it will include the conditions of health  cleanliness  atmosphere  greenery  cordiality etc  on the basis of those parameters  each of our mps should make one village of his or her constituency a model village by 2016  can t we do at least this  shouldn t we do this  if we have to build a nation  we should start from the village  make a model village  the reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme  it takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it  after 2016  select two more villages for this purpose  before we go for the general elections in 2019  and after 2019  each member of parliament  during his her tenure of 5 years must establish at least five model villages in his her area  i also call upon the members of parliament from urban areas to adopt one village of their choice  i also urge upon the members of parliament from rajya sabha to adopt one of the villages  if we provide one model village in each district of india then the surrounding villages shall be automatically inspired to follow that model  let us establish a model village  let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and facilities  the birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji happens to be on 11th october  on 11th october  the occasion of birth anniversary of jai prakash narayan ji  i will present a complete blueprint of    s   nsad adharsh gr   m yojana   members of parliament model village scheme  before all members of parliament and state governments  and i urge upon state governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states  all the members of legislative assembly resolve to establish a model village  you can imagine all the members of legislative assembly and all the members of parliament in the country establishing a model village  all of a sudden  there would be a model village in each block of india which could inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new direction and  therefore  we want to move ahead under this   s   nsad adarsh gr   m yojana      my dear brothers and sisters  ever since our government has taken charge  there has been a discussion in the newspapers  on t v  channels as to what would happen to planning commission  i believe that when planning commission was constituted  it was done on the basis of the circumstances and the needs of those times  in recent years  planning commission has contributed to the growth of the country in its own way  i respect that  i am proud of that  but the prevalent situation in the country is different  global scenario has also changed  governments are no longer the centre of economic activities  the scope of such activities has broadened  state governments have been at the center of development and i consider this a good indication  if we have to take india forward  it can happen only be taking the states forward   india s federal structure is more important today than in the last 60 years  to strengthen our federal structure  to make our federal structure vibrant  to take our federal structure as a heritage of development  a team of chief minister and prime minister should be there  a joint team of the centre and the states should move forward  then to do this job  we will have to think about giving the planning commission a look  so  i am saying from the rampart of the red fort that it is a very old system and it will have to be rejuvenated  it will have to be changed a lot  sometimes it costs more to repair the old house  but  it gives us no satisfaction  thereafter  we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period  we will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new design and structure  a new body  a new soul  a new thinking  a new direction  a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country based on creative thinking  public private partnership  optimum utilization of resources  utilization of youth power of the nation  to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development  to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure  very shortly  we are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in place of planning commission     brothers and sisters  today  on 15th august  we also have the birth anniversary of maharishi aurobindo  maharishi aurobindo  being a rebel  moved on to achieve the status of a yoga guru  with regard to the destiny of india  he remarked   i have a faith that the divine power and spiritual heritage of india will play an important role towards the welfare of the world   such sentiments were echoed by maharishi arvind  i strongly believe in the words of legends  i have great faith in the statements made by ascetics  sages   saints and that s why today at the ramparts of lal quila i am reminded of the words of swami viveknanda  he had said    i can see before my eyes mother india awakening once again  my mother india would be seated as the world guru  every indian would render service towards welfare of humanity  this legacy of india would be useful for the welfare of the world   these words were spoken by swami viveknanda ji in his own style  friends  the words of viveknanda ji can never be untrue  the words of viveknanda ji  his dream of seeing india ensconced as world guru  his vision  it is incumbent upon us to realize that dream  this capable country  blessed with natural bounty  this country of youth can do much for the world in the coming days     brothers and sisters  our foreign policy is a much talked about issue  i clearly believe that india s foreign policy can be multi dimensional  but there is an important issue to which i want to draw your attention that the way we fought for freedom  we fought together  we were not separate at that time  we were together  which was the government with us  what were the weapons available to us  there was a gandhi  a sardar and lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire  didn t we win in the struggle of freedom against that empire  did we not defeat the foreign powers  did we not force them to leave india  we were the ones  they were our ancestors only who showed this might  if the people of india could remove such a big empire without the power of the government  without weapons and even without resources  then friends  it is the need of the hour to eradicate poverty  can we not overcome poverty  can we not defeat poverty  my 125 crore dear countrymen  let us resolve to eradicate poverty  to win against it  let us move with the dream of poverty eradication from india  our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same problem  why not get together with all the saarc nations to plan out the fight against poverty  let s fight together and defeat poverty  let us see at least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of killing and getting killed  this is the land where incidents from siddharth s life happened  one bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the other took out that arrow to save it  they went to mother  whose bird  whose swan  whether killer s or saviour s  they asked of mother  the mother replied  saviour s  the saviour has more power than the killer and that makes him buddha in future  and that s why i seek cooperation from neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate with them  so that together with saarc countries we can create our importance and emerge as a power in the world  it is imperative that we work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty  shoulder to shoulder  i went to bhutan  nepal  all the dignitaries from saarc countries took part in oath taking ceremony  this marked a good beginning  this will definitely yield good results  it is my belief and this thinking of india  in the country and the world  that we want to do well to the countrymen and be useful for the welfare of the world  india wants such a hand to be extended  we are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them     brothers and sisters  today on 15th august we will resolve to do something for the country  let s be useful for the country  we will move ahead with a resolve to take the country forward  and i assure you  brothers and sisters  as well as my colleagues in the government  that if you work for 12 hours  i will do so for 13 hours  if you work for 14 hours  i will do for 15 hours  why  because i m amidst you not as a prime minister  but as the first servant  i have formed the government not as a ruler  but as a servant  brothers and sisters  i assure that this country has a destiny  it is destined to work for the welfare of the world  it was said by vivekanand ji  india is born  this hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny  one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare of the nation     once again i feel proud of the devotion  the sacrifices of the security forces of the country  para military forces of the country  all the security forces of the country to protect mother india  i say to the countrymen                                 eternal vigilance is the price of liberty   the army is vigilant  we should also be vigilant and the country scales new heights  we have to move forward with this resolution  speak loudly with me with full force      bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai  bharat mata ki jai     jai hind  jai hind  jai hind     vande mataram  vande mataram  vande mataram '"
